**Answer each of the following questions with *one sentence* including a brief explanation.**

1.  Finish the sentence with another student’s name: "If \[Name of Student\] doesn’t earn an A, then nobody should, because..." Explain your choice and your reasoning.

If Sydney doesn’t earn an A, then nobody should, because she always comes to class, asks questions, and works hard to learn the material/ complete the labs accurately. 

2.  What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.

As a computer science student, I have adapted to using languages like Python/ C, so the hardest part of the class for me was using map() instead of for loops, for example, and learning to work with vectors/ data frames in functions.

3.  What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.

As I mentioned, as I am a computer science student, naturally the easiest part for me was understanding the flow of the code, debugging the code, adapting to using a new IDE, and using github!

4.  What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.

The part of the class that surprised me the most is that you can create such visually pleasing html documents using R and it's not that hard, I can see using this tool in the future for other projects (which I wasn't expecting)!

5.  Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a quarter of STAT 331 that will help them be successful in learning.
